## **About Myself**

I am a marine electrical engineer and I work for a large international marine company "V.Group". I have experience in international crews.

Due to the fact that my current job forces me to be away from my family for a long time, I chose to study the IT industry.

I am currently studying front-end development. Completed HTML and CSS courses at freecodecamp. I am currently learning JavaScript.

I believe that my previous work and gained experience in working with an international team will help me successfully integrate front-end development.
